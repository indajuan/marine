This LIMS project aims to administrate and present physical oceanographic and biological data from the midriff archipelago region (MAR) of the Gulf of California, Mexico. The Gulf of California is a semi-enclosed sea, highly dynamic and productive. The MAR in the Gulf of California is characterized by an intense tidal mixing producing sharp thermal fronts.
<br><br>
The physical oceanographic processes are used to describe the distribution of larval fish habitats around the MAR in a three-dimensional form. The physical variables included in this LIMS are temperature, salinity, oxygen and fluorescence. The physical variables came from a SeaBird 911plus conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) profiler, and were provided by Dr. Emilio A. Inda-Diaz. The biological variables include the species, larval stage and abundance from 0 to 200m depth by 50m stratum, and were provided by Dr. Emilio A. Inda-Diaz. The sampling methods for the physical and biological variables are described in Inda-Diaz et al. (2010).
